# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This repository contains code and documentation for a customer segmentation analysis project. The analysis utilizes KMeans clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into customer behavior.

## Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to understand customer behavior by segmenting them into distinct groups based on their attributes. By identifying different customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer service, and optimize product offerings to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment.

## Folder Structure

- **data**: This folder contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- **notebooks**: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for EDA, PCA, and KMeans clustering.
- **results**: This folder stores any visualizations, tables, or other outputs generated during the analysis.
- **docs**: This folder contains any additional documentation related to the project.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab).
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in each notebook to perform EDA, PCA, and KMeans clustering.
5. Review the results and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
